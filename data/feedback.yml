          ‘We think it's really important to talk well with our partners. When we communicate openly and clearly, we can understand each other better and work together more effectively. We believe that good conversations build strong relationships and help us grow together. By listening carefully and sharing our thoughts openly, we can achieve great things together. Our goal is to keep the lines of communication open and friendly, so we can solve problems, come up with new solutions, and succeed together in the long run.’
